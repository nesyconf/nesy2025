title: 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025)
layout: home
---


The NeSy series is the longest standing gathering for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in neurosymbolic AI. NeSy is the annual meeting of the [Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning Association](https://nesyconf.org).

The [NeSy event series](https://nesyconf.org) celebrates neurosymbolic AI since 2005 when the first NeSy workshop took place in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of IJCAI2005. NeSy is about the integration of neural and symbolic AI, combining statistical machine learning based on neural networks with knowledge representation and reasoning from symbolic AI. 

Neural networks and statistical Machine Learning have achieved industrial relevance in a number of areas from healthcare to finance and business, obtaining state-of-the-art performance at language modelling, speech and image recognition, sensor data and graph analytics. Symbolic AI is challenged by such unstructured large data, but offers sound and well-understood formal reasoning and explanation via knowledge representation that can be inspected to interpret how decisions follow from data. Neural and symbolic AI approaches also contrast in the problems that they excel at: deep learning excels at scene recognition, but fails at planning and rich deductive reasoning.

Neurosymbolic AI aims to build rich computational AI models, systems and applications by combining neural and symbolic learning and reasoning. It hopes to create synergies among the strengths of neural and symbolic AI while overcoming their complementary weaknesses. The NeSy workshop series is the premier venue for the presentation and discussion of the theory and practice of neurosymbolic computing. Since NeSy 2005, the workshop provided an atmosphere for the free exchange of ideas, bringing together the community of scientists and practitioners that straddle the line between connectionism and symbolic AI.
