We invite you to submit to the 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025), held in Santa Cruz (CA, USA) from September 8-10, 2025.

NeSy is the premier annual conference of the research community working on neurosymbolic AI, integrating symbolic and neural approaches to learning and reasoning in AI. The proceedings of NeSy 2025 will be published as part of X.

===== Subject Areas =====

The NeSy conference invites theoretical, experimental and applied submissions on the integration of neural networks and symbolic AI.

This year, we have three Special Tracks:


Neurosymbolic Generative Models;
Neurosymbolic Methods for Trustworthy and Interpretable AI;
Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies and Neurosymbolic AI

In addition, we invite papers on all topics related to Neurosymbolic AI, including but not limited to
Informed Machine Learning;
Knowledge representation and reasoning using neural networks;
Code generation and knowledge engineering with neural networks, including with LLMs;
Studying and improving LLM reasoning with Neurosymbolic methods;
Neurosymbolic cognitive modelling;
Languages for Neurosymbolic AI, including differentiable and probabilistic programming languages;
Embedding methods for structured information;
Circuits and knowledge compilation for Neurosymbolic AI
Neurosymbolic methods for reinforcement learning, causality, structure learning, transfer, meta, multitask and continual learning, relational learning, graph neural networks;
Applications of Neurosymbolic AI, including in education, law, simulation, finance, healthcare, robotics, software engineering, systems engineering, bioinformatics, and visual intelligence

===== Submission guidelines =====

This year, papers must be submitted before the deadline on OpenReview: <TODO>

Full paper submissions should not exceed X pages. Please use the Latex template available at <TODO>.

Short paper submission should be original pieces of work that have not been published elsewhere and should not exceed X pages. Please use the same Latex template as full paper submissions. 

Extended abstracts should provide an overview of relevanthighly relevant papers in neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed X pages. The original papers should be recently published pieces of work at top conferences (e.g, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI etc.) and journals such as (e.g., AIJ, JAIR, MLJ, IEEE TNNLS, etc.). 

For any question about paper submissions contact us at: organisers@nesyconf.org 

Reviewing will be transparent. Paper authors must be listed on submissions. After notification, reviews of accepted papers will be posted online on OpenReviews along with the originally submitted version of the paper. Reviewers remain anonymous unless they opt in to them being named.

All questions about submissions should be addressed to organisers@nesyconf.org .
