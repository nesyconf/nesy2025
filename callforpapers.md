We invite you to submit papers to the 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025), held in Santa Cruz (CA, USA) from September 8-10, 2025.

NeSy is the premier annual conference of the research community working on neurosymbolic AI, integrating symbolic and neural approaches to learning, reasoning, and problem-solving in AI. Accepted papers of NeSy 2025 will be published in a volume of [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/).

## Subject Areas 
The NeSy conference invites theoretical, experimental and applied submissions on the integration of neural networks and symbolic AI.

This year, we have three Special Tracks:
- Neurosymbolic Generative Models;
- Neurosymbolic Methods for Trustworthy and Interpretable AI;
- Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies and Neurosymbolic AI

In addition, we invite papers on all topics related to Neurosymbolic AI, including but not limited to
- Informed Machine Learning;
- Addressing knowledge representation and reasoning tasks using neural networks;
- Code generation and knowledge engineering with neural networks, including with LLMs;
- Studying and improving LLM reasoning with Neurosymbolic methods;
- Neurosymbolic cognitive modelling;
- Languages for Neurosymbolic AI, including differentiable and probabilistic programming languages;
- Embedding methods for structured information;
- Circuits and knowledge compilation for Neurosymbolic AI;
- Specification and verification of machine/deep learning systems;
- Neurosymbolic methods for reinforcement learning, causality, structure learning, transfer, meta, multitask and continual learning, relational learning, graph neural networks;
- Applications of Neurosymbolic AI, including in education, law, simulation, finance, healthcare, robotics, software engineering, systems engineering, bioinformatics, and visual intelligence;

## Submission guidelines 
This year, papers must be submitted before the deadline on [our OpenReview page](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference). 
Full paper submissions should not exceed 10 pages, excluding references and supplementary materials. Please use the Latex template available at this link.

Short paper and late short paper submissions should be original pieces of work, or position papers. They should not have been published elsewhere and should not exceed 5 pages, excluding references and supplementary materials. Please use the same Latex template as full paper submissions. 

Full and short papers will be in the conference proceedings of NeSy 2025, which will be published with the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR).

Extended abstracts should provide an overview of relevant papers in neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed 2 pages. The original papers should be recently published pieces of work at top conferences (e.g, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI etc.) and journals such as (e.g., AIJ, JAIR, MLJ, IEEE TNNLS, NAI etc.). 

The conference will be held in-person, and authors of accepted papers are required to attend the conference physically to present their work. Please note that short paper and extended abstract notification is rather late to allow for late-breaking results â€” authors from outside the US need to make sure that they have enough time to obtain US visas. 

Reviewing will be double-blind. After notification, reviews of accepted papers will be posted online on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference) along with the originally submitted version of the paper. Reviewers remain anonymous unless they opt in to them being named. 

Accepted paper authors will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the [Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence journal](https://neurosymbolic-ai-journal.com/content/about-neurosymbolic-artificial-intelligence).

All questions about submissions should be addressed to [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org).
