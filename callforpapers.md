We invite you to submit papers to the 19th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2025), held in Santa Cruz (CA, USA) from September 8-10, 2025.

NeSy is the premier annual conference of the research community working on neurosymbolic AI, integrating symbolic and neural approaches to learning, reasoning, and problem-solving in AI. Accepted papers of NeSy 2025 will be published in a volume of [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/).

Please contact [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org) for any questions about submissions.

## Subject Areas 
The NeSy conference invites theoretical, experimental and applied submissions on the integration of neural networks and symbolic AI.

This year, we have three Special Tracks:
- [Neurosymbolic Generative Models]({{ site.url }}/nesy-generative-models);
- [Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies and Neurosymbolic AI]({{site.url}}/kgs-ontologies);
- [Neurosymbolic Methods for Trustworthy and Interpretable AI]({{site.url}}/thrusworthy-interpretable)

In addition, we invite papers on all topics related to Neurosymbolic AI, including but not limited to
- Informed Machine Learning;
- Addressing knowledge representation and reasoning tasks using neural networks;
- Code generation and knowledge engineering with neural networks, including with LLMs;
- Studying and improving LLM reasoning with Neurosymbolic methods;
- Neurosymbolic cognitive modelling;
- Languages for Neurosymbolic AI, including differentiable and probabilistic programming languages;
- Embedding methods for structured information;
- Circuits and knowledge compilation for Neurosymbolic AI;
- Specification and verification of machine/deep learning systems;
- Neurosymbolic methods for reinforcement learning, causality, structure learning, transfer, meta, multitask and continual learning, relational learning, graph neural networks;
- Applications of Neurosymbolic AI, including in education, law, simulation, finance, healthcare, robotics, software engineering, systems engineering, bioinformatics, and visual intelligence;

## Submission guidelines 
- All submissions should be made before the deadline on [our OpenReview page](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference). 
- Please use the **Latex template** available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_SmJI3rx548k6KkTPP5QLZoJ8lois26D?usp=sharing).
- Both full and short paper submissions should be original pieces of work or position papers. They should not have been published elsewhere. We have a strict policy on double submissions. 
- Full and short papers will be in the conference proceedings of NeSy 2025, which will be published with the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/).
- **Full paper** submissions should not exceed **10 pages**, excluding references and supplementary materials. 
- **Short paper and late short paper** submissions should not exceed **5 pages**, excluding references and supplementary materials.
- **Extended abstracts** should provide an overview of relevant papers in neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed **2 pages**. The original papers should be recently published pieces of work at top conferences (e.g, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI etc.) and journals such as (e.g., AIJ, JAIR, MLJ, IEEE TNNLS, NAI etc.). 
- **Industry abstracts** should provide an overview of the industrial effort related to neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed 2 pages. 
- **First round resubmissions in the late deadline** should fill in the text field in the form indicating the changes done from the first round and how they address the reviewers’ comments. These papers will be assigned to the same reviewers as the first round. 

The conference will be held **in-person**, and authors of accepted papers are required to attend the conference physically to present their work. Please note that the late paper and extended abstract notification is rather close to the conference to allow for late-breaking results — authors from outside the US need to make sure that they have enough time to obtain **US visas**. 

**Reviewing** will be double-blind. After notification, reviews of accepted papers will be posted online on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference) along with the originally submitted version of the paper. Reviewers remain anonymous unless they opt in to them being named. 

Accepted paper authors will be invited to submit **extended versions** of papers to a special issue of the [Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence journal](https://neurosymbolic-ai-journal.com/content/about-neurosymbolic-artificial-intelligence).

All questions about submissions should be addressed to [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org).
