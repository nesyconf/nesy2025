Today, reasoning is commonly interpreted as large language models generating chains of thought. Yet historically, AI reasoning had a very different meaning: executing algorithms that manipulated symbols to perform logical or probabilistic deduction and derive definite answers to questions about knowledge. In this talk, I show that such old-fashioned ideas are very relevant to reasoning with large language models today. In particular, I will demonstrate that integrating symbolic reasoning algorithms directly into the architecture of language models enables state-of-the-art capabilities in controllable text generation, alignment, and mathematical reasoning. These capabilities are built on top of tractable probabilistic circuit models that approximate the distribution of the large language modelâ€™s future behavior, and allow for efficient reasoning on the GPU. I will further show that the same ideas naturally extend to neurosymbolic offline reinforcement learning and image diffusion.
