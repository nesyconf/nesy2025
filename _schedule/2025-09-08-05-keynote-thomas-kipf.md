Objects in some sense are the "symbols" of the physical world. They play an important role in human cognition, perception, and in our interaction with the world. In the context of generative AI, this raises the question whether objects will need some special treatment when developing models that learn about the physical world. This talk will touch upon this question from multiple angles: from object representation learning, object-centric architectures to object-centric control of generative models.
