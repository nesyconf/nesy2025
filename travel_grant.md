We are pleased to announce travel assistance opportunities for PhD students and early career researchers at US Universities attending NeSy 2025. These sponsorships are intended to support in-person participation, especially for individuals from underrepresented groups who might be attending a conference in person for the first time.  This is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and therefore applicants must be students or early career researchers at US universities.

The travel support is designed to help offset costs associated with attending NeSy 2025, so that students and emerging scholars can engage fully in the program, present their work, and connect with peers, mentors, and industry professionals.
Recipients of this travel assistance will gain access to:
- _Mentorship opportunities_ with senior researchers in the field.
- _An additional poster session_ to showcase their work.

## Eligibility

- Student applicants: The applicant should currently be a registered student at a higher education institution in the U.S.
