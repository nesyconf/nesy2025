### Transportation* (Please see below for Parking/Bus Information to Campus)


We suggest to make your reservations as soon as possible to obtain the best rate. We  recommend flying into San Jose International Airport (SJC), although San Francisco International Airport (SFO) offers more international options. Drive times from the airports to the UCSC area are as follows: San Jose airport ~45 minutes, San Francisco airport ~90 minutes, Oakland airport ~90 minutes.


### Ground transportation to/from airport
We recommend using ride-sharing services (e.g., Uber, Lyft) from home to your local Airport, and the Airport to Santa Cruz.

### Lodging

You can find local lodging options in Santa Cruz at [https://www.santacruz.org/places-to-stay/](https://www.santacruz.org/places-to-stay/). Most visitors should plan on staying from September 8th to 10th.  You can also choose to stay an additional night (should you want to spend more time exploring Santa Cruz on your own, for instance).

### Parking

If you choose to drive to campus, you will need to purchase a UCSC parking permit to park in all non-ParkMobile parking spaces on campus.


For the day portion, it is recommended you park at either the Core West Parking Structure (UCSC parking permit) or the North Perimeter Lot (ParkMobile daily rate), as these are the closest to our event.
